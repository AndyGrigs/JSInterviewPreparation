/*  
Grandpa's hand isn't as steady as it used to be. You finally convinced him
to start using a password manager, but he accidentally typed and saved his
password with a bunch of extra characters. Help him recover his password by 
removing all the duplicate characters. 

Your function should take in a string of characters and return a
string with the duplicate characters removed. Assume that your input
is lowercased with only letters and numbers.  

Example input: "aabbccb1212"
Example output: "abc12"
